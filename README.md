<h1>2D-GravitySimulator</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a gravitational space simulation implemented using Python and Pygame. It allows users to launch spacecraft towards a planet under the influence of gravitational forces. The simulation visually represents the gravitational interactions between the spacecraft and the planet.
<br />


<h3>Features</h3>

- <b>Gravitational Physics Simulation:</b> Simulates gravitational attraction between a spacecraft and a planet based on Newton's law of gravitation 
- <b>Interactive User Interface</b> Users can launch spacecraft by clicking on the screen, and setting their initial direction.
- <b>Visual Feedback: </b>Provides visual feedback with images for spacecraft and planets, along with sound effects upon collision.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashwanss/2D-GravitySimulator.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Click anywhere on the screen to launch a spacecraft towards the planet.
- Observe how the spacecraft interacts with the gravitational field of the planet.
- Enjoy the visual and audio feedback upon collision or spacecraft removal.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests or open issues for any bugs, feature requests, or suggestions.
